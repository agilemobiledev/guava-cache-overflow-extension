A Guava cache extension that allows caches to persist cache entries when they cannot longer be stored in memory.
An implementation that overflows to the file system is provided including a corresponding CacheBuilder with similar semantics than the Guava CacheBuilder.

For creating a cache that overflows to disk, just proceed as when using the Guava CacheBuilder:

Cache<String, String> stringCache =
  FileSystemCacheBuilder.newBuilder()
    .maximumSize(100L)
    .softValues()
    .build();

Note: This cache implementation has slightly different semantics than the Cache / LoadingCache interface contracts specify:
* Any limits set for this cache do only concern the cache's memory size. Cache entries exceeding this limit will overflow to disk.
* When calling the non-argument invalidateAll() method, the RemovalListener is only informed about the expiration of entries that
  are still stored in memory.
* When the cache is not longer in use, its invalidateAll() method should be called if the cache's overflow folder is not cleared by
  the operating system.
